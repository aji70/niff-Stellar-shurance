# NiffyInsur Frontend

Next.js 15 frontend for the NiffyInsur decentralised insurance protocol.

## Getting started

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# fill in NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL at minimum
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Environment variables

See `.env.example` for the full list with ownership notes.

## Running unit tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Running e2e tests (Playwright)

### Prerequisites

Install Playwright browsers once after `npm install`:

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

### Local run (against dev server)

The `webServer` config in `playwright.config.ts` starts `next dev` automatically:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Interactive UI mode (great for debugging):

```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### Local run (against production build)

```bash
npm run build
npx next start &
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 npx playwright test
```

### Viewing reports

```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

### Test structure

```
e2e/
  fixtures/
    api.ts          — API route mocks (no real backend needed)
    wallet.ts       — Freighter wallet stub
  landing.spec.ts
  quote.spec.ts
  wallet-connect.spec.ts
  claims-dashboard.spec.ts
  quarantine/       — flaky tests pending fix (see flake policy below)
```

### Flake policy

- Tests retry up to **2 times** in CI (`retries: 2` in `playwright.config.ts`).
- Hard waits (`page.waitForTimeout`) are **forbidden**; use `expect` polling.
- A test that fails consistently after 2 retries must be moved to `e2e/quarantine/`
  and a GitHub issue opened within **48 hours**.
- Quarantined tests are excluded from the required CI check until fixed.

### CI artifacts

On failure, the Playwright job uploads traces and screenshots to the
`playwright-artifacts-<sha>` artifact (retained 7 days). Download and open:

```bash
npx playwright show-report path/to/downloaded/playwright-report
```

## React Query configuration

All React Query settings are centralized in `src/lib/query/queryClientConfig.ts`. Per-component overrides are discouraged — add a new named constant to `STALE_TIMES` instead.

### Stale times

| Query type | Stale time | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `policies` | 30 s | Changes only on user-initiated transactions |
| `claims` | 10 s | Any holder can file; moderate freshness needed |
| `votes` | 5 s | Active voting windows are time-sensitive |
| `ledger` | 5 s | New ledger every ~5 s |
| `default` | 15 s | Catch-all for uncategorized queries |

### Retry policy

- Max **3 retries** for transient errors (network failures, 5xx, 429).
- **No retry** for 4xx client errors (except 429 with Retry-After).
- Exponential backoff: 1 s → 2 s → 4 s, capped at 30 s.

### Background refetch

- `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` globally. Enable per-query only for time-sensitive queries (e.g. active votes) by passing `refetchOnWindowFocus: true`.
- `refetchOnReconnect: true` — always resync after coming back online.
- `refetchIntervalInBackground: false` — respects the Page Visibility API; no polling on hidden tabs.

### Offline support

Use `useNetworkAwareQuery` (`src/lib/query/useNetworkAwareQuery.ts`) instead of `useQuery` for any query that uses `refetchInterval`. It automatically pauses interval-based refetch when the browser is offline or the tab is hidden, preventing battery drain on mobile.

```ts
import { useNetworkAwareQuery, STALE_TIMES } from '@/lib/query';

const { data } = useNetworkAwareQuery({
  queryKey: ['votes', claimId],
  queryFn: () => fetchVoteTallies(claimId),
  staleTime: STALE_TIMES.votes,
  refetchInterval: 5_000,
  refetchOnWindowFocus: true, // enabled for time-sensitive vote data
});
```

## Analytics

Analytics uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io) (cookieless, no PII).
Disabled by default in local dev. See `src/lib/analytics.ts` for the event
catalog and `src/app/privacy/page.tsx` for the privacy policy.

To enable locally:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_DOMAIN=your-domain.com
```

## Architecture notes

### Route error boundaries (`error.tsx`)

Next.js **App Router** isolates render failures per route **segment** using a
client `error.tsx` next to `page.tsx` / `layout.tsx`. When a segment throws
during render (or in a child Server/Client component during that render pass),
only that subtree is replaced by the error UI; the root layout (navigation,
wallet provider, etc.) keeps running.

**Current segment boundaries**

| Segment      | Path              | Role |
|-------------|-------------------|------|
| Claims      | `app/claims/`     | Claims board list and nested routes |
| Policies    | `app/policies/`   | Policy dashboard (`PolicyDashboard`); `/dashboard` redirects here |
| Admin       | `app/admin/`      | Admin placeholder segment |
| Policy flow | `app/policy/`     | Quote/bind policy wizard |
| Quote       | `app/quote/`      | Quote flow |
| Support     | `app/support/`    | Support |

Shared UI: `RouteError` (`src/components/route-error.tsx`) — user-safe message,
support reference when present, **Try again** (`reset()`), **Go to dashboard**
link. Development-only collapsible stack trace.

**Observability:** `logRouteSegmentError` (`src/lib/observability.ts`) records
anonymized metadata in production via Plausible (`route_segment_error`: segment,
error name, optional digest). **No** `error.message` or stack is sent to
analytics or shown to users in production.

**Out of scope for these boundaries:** Wallet signing and other **event
handler** errors are not caught by `error.tsx`; components must handle those
inline (try/catch / toast) so users get immediate feedback without replacing the
whole segment.
